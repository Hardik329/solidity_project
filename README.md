# solidity_project

I have made my own ERC20 token in this project.

## Description

I have made my own ERC20 token in this project using solidity. I have added its name, abbreviation, count of total supply of the token, a mapping to store the balance corresponding to address and functions to mint and burn the tokens.

## Getting Started


### Executing program

* Copy the myToken.sol and paste it in the remix IDE.
* Compile the file in remix and deploy the contract.
* Run transactions to access the variables and functions to make desired changes.
